# ⚡️ Unsafe Commands

The plugin has three unsafe commands that you will only need in rare cases.

### [hashtag](\#delete)    delete

This command will delete the crop data of this chunk forever, please operate with caution

### [hashtag](\#restore)    restore

This command will restore the blocks to the real world based on the data recorded by customcrops. This command is only valid for one section, that is, a 16x16x16 area.

### [hashtag](\#fix)    fix

This command will re-record the data into the plugin based on the real-world block and entity states. At the same time, incorrect data in the data will be removed. This command is only valid for one section, that is, a 16x16x16 area.
